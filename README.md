# Hodgkin-Huxley model
Here I archive my code that belongs to the Hodgkin Huxley model. The model is written in cython (ends with .pyx). Before running a script written in cython, you need to cythonize this script first. Execute setup.py in your anaconda prompt window using setup.py build_ext --inplace to cythonize the model.
